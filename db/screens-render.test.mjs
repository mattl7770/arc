/**
 * Headless RENDER test of the recipes/grocery screens — the real .tsx screen
 * components (app/recipes, recipe-detail, recipe-edit, recipe-import, grocery,
 * plus the edited nutrition hub and meal-detail) rendered to HTML via
 * react-native-web + react-dom/server, over a node:sqlite database running the
 * REAL migrations. Every synchronous DB read the screens do in their useState
 * initializers executes for real; a crash in any component body fails the
 * suite; key content is asserted in the rendered output.
 *
 * What this deliberately is NOT: a look/feel or interaction verdict — effects
 * don't run in a server render, and taps can't be simulated here. Device
 * verification stays the on-device checklist in docs/recipes-grocery.md §10
 * (memory: verify on device, not web).
 *
 * Run: npm run db:test (via node --import ./db/register-render-hooks.mjs).
