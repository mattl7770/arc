# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## 2026-07-22 — Project Naming

**Decision:** Name the project **ARC** (Architecture for Resilience & Continuity)

**Reasoning:**  
Short, strong, systemic. Works as both a word and an acronym. Avoids collision with Bryan Johnson’s “Blueprint” while capturing the OS / protocol / long-term resilience nature of the system.

## 2026-07-22 — Starting Tech Stack

**Decision:** Begin with Expo + React Native (TypeScript) + Supabase.

**Reasoning:**  
Maximum iteration speed while discovering the correct UX and data model. User already has strong Expo experience. AI coding tools currently perform better on this stack. Clean path to native SwiftUI later once the product is proven.

**Consequences:**  
- Faster earlying of home screen, coach, and core loops  
- Will eventually need a native port decision  
- HealthKit integration via Expo modules + possible custom native code later

## 2026-07-22 — Lab Strategy

**Decision:** Use Function Health as the primary comprehensive lab backend. Ingest via PDF download + structured parsing.

**Reasoning:**  
Best current combination of breadth (160+ biomarkers), quality, and accessibility. Avoids building phlebotomy/logistics. PDF parsing is reliable enough in 2026 with strong LLMs.

## 2026-07-22 — Home Screen Philosophy

**Decision:** The home screen is sacred and must remain ruthlessly directive. Full data exploration lives elsewhere.

**Reasoning:**  
The primary job of the app is to make the highest-leverage next action obvious. Information density is the enemy of daily execution.

---

## 2026-07-22 — Scoring System

**Decision:** Do not start with a single composite “Don’t Die Score.” Begin with multi-pillar status + clear actions. Revisit biological age / velocity later.

**Reasoning:**  
Composite scores force arbitrary weightings and can demotivate. Better to keep signals separate and let the Coach synthesize.

## 2026-07-21 — Enum vs. Text in the Schema

**Decision:** Use a Postgres enum where ARC owns the vocabulary; use `text` where an external system owns it. In practice: enums for `biological_sex`, `biomarker_category`, `data_source`, `protocol_type`, `authorship`, `log_entry_type`, `log_entry_status`, `wearable_device`; plain `text` for `wearable_data.metric_type`.

**Reasoning:**  
Enums give typo protection and generate exact string unions in `src/types/database.ts`, which is worth a migration when we control the list. `metric_type` is the exception: Oura, WHOOP, Ultrahuman and Terra add metrics on their schedule, and an enum there would mean a migration every time a vendor ships a new field.

**Consequences:**  
- Adding an enum value is a one-line migration (`alter type ... add value`), never a data rewrite.
- `metric_type` is guarded by a `^[a-z0-9_]+$` check constraint instead of the type system, so the normalisation layer must own that vocabulary.

## 2026-07-21 — `user_id` on Child Tables + Composite Foreign Keys

**Decision:** Carry `user_id` on `log_entries` and `protocol_versions` even though the spec derives ownership through the parent. Enforce consistency with composite foreign keys — `(daily_log_id, user_id) → daily_logs(id, user_id)` and `(protocol_id, user_id) → protocols(id, user_id)` — backed by `unique (id, user_id)` on the parents. Same pattern for `lab_results → lab_reports`.

**Reasoning:**  
`docs/data-model.md` asks for “user_id on everything.” Denormalising it lets every RLS policy be a flat `auth.uid() = user_id` rather than an `EXISTS` subquery against the parent, which is materially faster per row. The composite FK is what makes the denormalised column trustworthy: it is structurally impossible to attach a row to another user’s parent. Verified by test.

**Consequences:**  
- Parent tables carry a redundant `unique (id, user_id)` index to serve as the FK target.
- Writers must set `user_id` explicitly on child inserts.

## 2026-07-21 — Delete Semantics

**Decision:** Deleting a protocol sets `log_entries.protocol_id` to NULL rather than cascading. Deleting a lab report cascades to the `lab_results` parsed out of it. Deleting a daily log cascades to its entries.

**Reasoning:**  
Execution history is the record of what actually happened and must survive protocol churn — losing a year of adherence data because a supplement stack was retired would be unacceptable. Parsed lab results, by contrast, are derived data: they can be regenerated from the stored PDF, so they follow their report. Manually entered results have `report_id` NULL and are untouched.

---

## 2026-07-21 — Protocol Versions Are Immutable

**Decision:** `protocol_versions` has `created_at` but deliberately no `updated_at` and no update path. Changing a protocol means inserting a new version and moving `protocols.current_version_id`.

**Reasoning:**  
“Protocols are versioned and treatable like code” (CLAUDE.md §2). A version you can edit in place is not a version. This also keeps n-of-1 experiments honest: an experiment can reference the exact version it ran against.

---

## 2026-07-21 — RLS Policy Shape

**Decision:** One `FOR ALL` policy per owned table, with `auth.uid()` wrapped in a scalar subquery: `using ((select auth.uid()) = user_id)`. `biomarkers` is global reference data with a read-only policy for authenticated users and no write policy at all.

**Reasoning:**  
The predicate is identical across select/insert/update/delete, so four separate policies would be four copies of one line. Wrapping `auth.uid()` in a subquery lets Postgres evaluate it once per statement as an InitPlan rather than once per row — the documented Supabase performance pattern. Biomarker rows are seeded by the service role, which bypasses RLS, so no write policy is needed or wanted.
